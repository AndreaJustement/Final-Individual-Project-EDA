# EDA - Used cars
# EDA individual project

##Introduction
This workbook guides you through an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a used car data set. The main goal is to thoroughly understand the data set to make informed decisions in subsequent machine learning tasks. Extract important variables, identify outliers and understand the relationships between different variables.

## Previous requirements
-Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Data file: `vehicles.csv.tar.gz` (make sure it is extracted before running the notebook)

## Use
1. Make sure Python and all dependent libraries are installed.
2. Download and extract the `vehicles.csv.tar.gz` dataset.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to follow the analysis steps.

##Content
1. **General Analysis**: Initial loading and examination of the data set, including:
      - Understand the meanings of the characteristics.
      - Identify unique values.
      - Statistical summaries
      - Function syntax and semantic checks.

2. **Data cleaning and preparation**: Handling missing values, correcting data types and solving semantic problems.

3. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis that involves:
      - Visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, etc.)
      - Correlation analysis
      - Detection and management of outliers

4. **Model Development**: Creating a linear regression model to predict car prices based on the cleaned data set. Analysis of model performance using MSE and R^2 metrics.

## Conclusion
Summary of findings and model performance, along with considerations for improving the model.
