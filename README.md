##Introduction
This notebook guides you through an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a used car dataset. The primary aim is to understand the dataset thoroughly to make informed decisions in subsequent Machine Learning tasks. You'll learn to extract important variables, identify outliers, and understand relationships between different variables.

## Prerequisites
-Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Data File: `vehicles.csv.tar.gz` (ensure it is extracted before running the notebook)

## Usage
1. Ensure Python and all dependent libraries are installed.
2. Download and extract the dataset `vehicles.csv.tar.gz`.
3. Run the notebook cell-by-cell to follow the analysis steps.

##Contents
1. **General Analysis**: Initial loading and examination of the dataset, including:
    - Understanding feature meanings
    - Identifying unique values
    - Statistical summaries
    - Syntax and semantic checks on features

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and resolving semantic issues.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis involving:
    - Visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, etc.)
    - Correlation analysis
    - Outlier detection and handling

4. **Model Development**: Building a linear regression model to predict car prices based on the cleaned dataset. Analysis of model performance using MSE and R^2 metrics.

## Conclusion
Summary of findings and model performance, along with considerations for improving the model.
